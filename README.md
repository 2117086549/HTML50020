# Cutthroat Bingo

[Play The Game](http://cutthroatbingo.com/)

This repo was inspired by a [tweet](https://twitter.com/funugly/status/671861056499752962) from [Chelsea McAlarney](https://twitter.com/funugly) wherein she created a bingo style game board for the [Food Network](http://www.foodnetwork.com/) television show [Cutthroat Kitchen](http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/cutthroat-kitchen.html) hosted by [Alton Brown](http://altonbrown.com/).

I'm a big fan of the show and thought it might be fun to make the bingo card interactive and randomly generated so folks could play with their friends.

This is a quick first pass at a minimally viable game which is just barely more usable than printing out cards and using bingo daubers. The board is generated and cells can be marked/unmarked by clicking on them, that's it. It functions on mobile devices (landscape mode preferred), tablets, and large screens.

## Licensing
This game and the website where it is hosted [cutthroatbingo.com](http://cutthroatbingo.com/) will forever be open source and free under the MIT license. 

Thanks in advance to the Food Network for not sending me a cease and desist order.

## Contributing
Contributions in the form of design (there currently is none), feature development, or new situation suggestions are welcome! Please use the [issues page](https://github.com/MattSurabian/cutthroat-bingo/issues) of this repository to suggest changes or open a pull request. I'll update this README at some point with better instructions for developers that would like to play with the code locally, but for now feel free to send questions via [the issues page](https://github.com/MattSurabian/cutthroat-bingo/issues) if you run into problems.
